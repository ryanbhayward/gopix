RBH 2020, based on Hex-board drawing programs by Cameron Browne,
 and a perl generation program by Jack van Rijswijck.
__________
usage:
  first, modify any *.geo files you want to generate in autopix
  then ...

  in autopix, execute:
    ./make.sh
  in this direct, execute:
    make geo

TODO

* generate larger boards.
  you could probably figure out how to do base-6 by hand,
  but better would be to use the next idea

* automate the generation of cell corners (and cell perimeter-corner-sets).
  currently I use center centroids, but this is ad hoc and not automated.
  Either use geometry to define corner x-y coordinates,
  or automatically generate the Voronoi diagram (this code must be out there).
  If you use geometry, first step
  is to automatically generate these sets for the current board,
  one approach to this is to redefine corners of the board's perimeter
  to include all the corners that will be corners of the larger board
  (currently some of these are not corners when on the perimeter,
   this makes the code a bit confusing.
   better would be to include them all, but just
   be aware of that when generating corner edges)

*  currently when showing a game in progress, I put a stone (filled circle)
   in a cell.  more elegant would be to color the cell.
   you will need 4 grayscale shades, with these approximate postscript values:

    0    black, for B-stones
     .6  dark grey, for edges on the original board
     .85 light grey, to indicate empty cells
    1    white, for W-stones 

   this will look cool :)

* generate other Schensted board families, that use different cell patterns,
  see the googleref for images of the base-9 tournament schensted board

------------

This code generates postscript image files (.eps)
for the family of geodesic-Y boards based on the
board by Schensted which has 5 cells on its base.

Currently this code generates figures with any base from 2 to 5.

There are some ugly things that could be automated that would
allow generation of larger base boards in this family.

----------
There are two styles of board
* normal style, where each cell is drawn as a polygon, 
  defined by the corners of the perimeter

* dual style (that's a term from graph theory),
  where each cell is represented as a node (dot),
  and each adjacent cell is joine by an edge (line).

---------
centers for smaller boards:
base 2
            0
          2   1
      
base 3
        3
    8   0   4
      2   1
   7    6    5
